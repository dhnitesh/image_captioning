# 🎭 AI Image Caption Generator: Because Even Your Photos Need a Comedian

Welcome to the most sarcastic, witty, and occasionally accurate image captioning tool in the universe! 🌍✨

## 🤖 What Does This Magic Do?

Ever looked at a photo and thought, "I wonder what an AI would say about this?" Well, wonder no more! This little digital genius will:

- 👀 Stare at your images with the intensity of a thousand suns
- 🧠 Think *really* hard (like, REALLY hard) about what it sees
- 🗣️ Spit out captions that range from "surprisingly accurate" to "hilariously wrong"
- 🎪 Provide endless entertainment for you and your friends

## 🚀 Features That Will Blow Your Mind (Or At Least Mildly Amuse You)

- **State-of-the-Art AI**: Uses a Vision Transformer that probably knows more about your photos than you do
- **GPU Support**: Works with CUDA (if your GPU is from this century)
- **CPU Fallback**: Don't have a fancy GPU? No problem! It'll run on your toaster if needed
- **Elephant Detection**: Surprisingly good at spotting elephants (see `ele.jpg` for proof!)
- **Warning Generator**: Comes with free warnings about attention masks (because who doesn't love a good warning?)

## 🛠️ Installation (The "Please Don't Break Your Computer" Guide)

1. **Clone this masterpiece:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhnitesh/image_captioning.git
   cd image_captioning
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (because isolation is key):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
   ```

3. **Install the magical dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Cross your fingers and pray to the AI gods** 🙏

## 🎮 How to Use This Digital Oracle

1. **Put your image in the folder** (we've included a sample elephant because... elephants are cool)

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python demo.py
   ```

3. **Watch in amazement** as the AI either:
   - Correctly identifies your image ✅
   - Comes up with something hilariously wrong ❌
   - Has an existential crisis about attention masks 🤔

## 📸 Example Output

```
Using device: cpu (because your GPU said "nah, bro")
Prediction: ['elephants standing in a grassy field']
```

*Translation: "I see big gray things in green stuff. I'm probably right."*

## ⚠️ Warning Labels (Because Lawyers Exist)

- May cause uncontrollable laughter
- Side effects include: questioning AI intelligence, wondering why you installed this, and showing it to all your friends
- Not recommended for professional photography captioning (unless you want some very confused clients)
- May develop a personality and start judging your photo-taking skills

## 🐛 Known Issues (Features, Really)

- Sometimes thinks everything is a hospital bed (we're working on its medical degree)
- Occasional existential warnings about pad tokens
- May require therapy after seeing your vacation photos
- GPU compatibility issues with RTX 5070 (it's too new and fancy for us mere mortals)

## 🤝 Contributing

Got ideas to make this even more ridiculous? Want to teach it new ways to misidentify objects? Pull requests welcome! 

Bonus points if you can make it funnier than it already is (challenge accepted).

## 🎉 Special Thanks

- To the elephants who posed for `ele.jpg` 🐘
- To PyTorch for making AI accessible to mere mortals
- To transformers library for doing the heavy lifting while we take the credit
- To caffeine for making this project possible ☕

## 🔮 Future Plans

- [ ] Teach it to be even more sarcastic
- [ ] Add support for memes (because why not?)
- [ ] Make it write poetry about your photos
- [ ] World domination (just kidding... or are we?)
